This game is based on the popular multiplayer title Slither and simulates a real-time multiplayer environment. The project is implemented using JavaScript. While alternative implementations using different technologies are available, this approach is designed to be simple, efficient, and well optimized. Multiplayer functionality has been included, and WebSocket support can be integrated using any backend service, such as Supabase. The project can be further modified or extended based on specific requirements. I hope you find this project useful. Thank you.
